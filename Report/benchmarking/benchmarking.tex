\section{Benchmarking}
\label{sec:benchmarking}

Throughout the project, a set of files will be used to test the algorithms that
are developed; their correctness and effectiveness, speed and resource use.
Several of these files contain real data formated in the same way as would be
expected for data given to the plugin in general use, the others contain
simulated or uniform data for testing. The files that will be used are detailed
in Table~\ref{tab:benchmarking-files}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular} {l r r}
	\toprule
	File Name & Size & Points \\
	\midrule
	\texttt{palm-1.txt} & \SI{12}{\mebi\byte} & 65572 \\
	\texttt{palm-2.txt} & \SI{6.4}{\mebi\byte} & 36672 \\
	\texttt{palm-3.txt} & \SI{5.8}{\mebi\byte} & 33342 \\
	\texttt{palm-3-small.txt} & \SI{176}{\kibi\byte} & 1000 \\
	\texttt{uniform.txt} & \SI{22}{\mebi\byte} & 2000000 \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\caption[Sample data files used for testing and benchmarking.]{Files containing
	sample data are used for benchmarking throughout the project. A range of
	number of points per file, type of clustering expected for each file and
	the range of coordinates the points exist over is chosen to simulate
	different use cases.}\label{tab:benchmarking-files}
\end{table}

Note that \texttt{palm-3-small.txt} is a subset of \texttt{palm-3.txt} which
is used for simply checking correctness of algorithms. A summary of the
columns that are included in the files, used and unused fields, is included in
Appendix~\ref{app:data_file_structure} and a summary of the hardware that was
used when benchmarking the algorithms is shown in
Appendix~\ref{app:benchmarking_hardware}.
