\section{Benchmarking}
\label{sec:benchmarking}

Throughout the project, a set of files wil be used to test the algorithms that
are developed, their correctness and effectiveness, speed and resource use.
These files contain real data formated in the same way as would be expected for
data given to the plugin in general use. The four files that will be used are
detailed in table~\ref{tab:menchmarking_files}.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\begin{tabu} to \linewidth {c X l}
	\toprule
	File Name & Size & No. of points \\
	\midrule
	\texttt{palm_1.txt} & \SI{12}{\mega\bytes} & 65572 \\
	\texttt{palm_2.txt} & \SI{6.4}{\mega\bytes} & 36672 \\
	\texttt{palm_3.txt} & \SI{5.8}{\mega\bytes} & 33342 \\
	\texttt{palm_3_small.txt} & \SI{176}{\kilo\bytes} & 1000 \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabu}

Note that \texttt{palm_3_small.txt} is a subset of \texttt{palm_3.txt} which is
used for simply checking correctess of alogorithms. A summary of the columns
that are included in the files, used and unused fields, is included in
Appendix~\ref{app:columns}.
