\section{Benchmarking}
\label{sec:benchmarking}

Throughout the project, a set of files will be used to test the algorithms
that are developed; their correctness and effectiveness, speed and resource
use.  These files contain real data formated in the same way as would be
expected for data given to the plugin in general use. The files that will be
used are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:benchmarking-files}.

\begin{tabular} {l c r}
	\toprule
	File Name & Size & Points \\
	\midrule
	\texttt{palm-1.txt} & \SI{12}{\mebi\byte} & 65572 \\
	\texttt{palm-2.txt} & \SI{6.4}{\mebi\byte} & 36672 \\
	\texttt{palm-3.txt} & \SI{5.8}{\mebi\byte} & 33342 \\
	\texttt{palm-3-small.txt} & \SI{176}{\kibi\byte} & 1000 \\
	\texttt{uniform.txt} & \SI{22}{\mebi\byte} & 2000000 \\

\end{tabular}

\caption{These files containing sample data are used for benchmarking
	throughout the project.}\label{tab:benchmarking-files}
\end{table}

Note that \texttt{palm-3-small.txt} is a subset of \texttt{palm-3.txt} which
is used for simply checking correctness of algorithms. A summary of the
columns that are included in the files, used and unused fields, is included in
Appendix~\ref{app:data_file_structure}.
