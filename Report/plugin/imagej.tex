\part{ImageJ Plugin}
\label{prt:imagej_plugin}

ImageJ is a Java based image manipulation program written and maintained by
developers at the National Institute of Health which is in the public domain
and is open sourced. It is widely used in medical and biological research and
has an open API to allow extension via macros, plugins and scripts.

Since they offer significantly better integration, meaning speed and efficiency
improvements, a plugin is chosen to integrate this project into ImageJ. A
plugin was chosen over macros since these often suffer performance loss when
more than a few steps are involved, and scripts since these do not offer such
tight integration with the rest of the program.

The plugin shall allow a user to load a data set, as gathered from STORM, PALM
or similar imaging techniques discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:sub_diffraction_limit_imaging}, choose the format of the data
(the columns that are of interest etc.) analyse the data for clusters and
receive detailed information regarding the clusters that were found.
