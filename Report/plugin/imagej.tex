\section{ImageJ}
\label{sec:imagej}

Imagej is an public domain, Java based image manipulation program written and
maintained by developers at the National Institute of Health. It is widly used
in medical and biological research and has an open API to allow extension via
macros, plugins and scripts.

Since they offer significantly betting integration, meaning speed and
efficiency improvements, a plugin is chosen to inegrate this project into
ImageJ over macros, which suffer performace loss when more than a few steps are
involved, and scripts which do not offer such tight integration with the rest
of the program.

The plugin shall allow a user to load a data set, as gathered from STORM, PALM
or similar imaging techniques discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:sub_diffraction_limit_imaging}, choose the format of the data
(the coloumns that are of interest etc.) analyse the data for clusters and
receive detailed information regarding the clusters that were found.
