\section{ImageJ Plugin}
\label{sec:imagej_plugin}

The first version of the plugin simply allowed the user to visualise the data,
once it had been processed and entered into a quadtree. Though this provided
little benefit to the researcher producing data, it can be useful to simply get
an insight into the process that a program is using to analyse one's data so
that the results can be better interpretted. For this reason, this version
served as a foundation for later versions of the plugin so that, when loading
data, a user gets the opportunity to view the data before proceding with the
analysis.

The analytical steps that are undertaken are descibed in more detail in later
sections.
