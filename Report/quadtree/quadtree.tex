\section{Quadtrees}
\label{sec:quadtrees}

Since the simple grid method described in section~\ref{sec:simple_grid_method}
performs slowly and does not offer good cluster analysis, a different approach
is needed. The chosen method is to use a quadtree data structure.

Quadtrees are a type of recursive abstract data type in the form of a tree
where every node has exactly zero or four children. A node with zero children
is a leaf and contains some information, value or quantity. A node with four
children is not a leaf and cannot hold information.

Quadtrees are often used in image processing since the four children of the
root node can naturally represent the four quadrants of the image; upper left,
upper right, lower left and lower right. Since each of these children is also a
quadtree, the image can be subdivided to any arbitrary depth. From this point,
information about the image can be ``seen'' more easily by the computer and
statistics calculated.

In order to identify a node uniquely in the tree, each node is given a code
that is built up from it's parent code plus some value that identifies it
among it's siblings. The root node is usually chosen to have an empty code so
that the first four children are given the first level codes.

The choice of in what order to label the children is important if the order
in which the nodes are placed is important. For spatial indexing, for example,
each node represents a quadrant in two dimensional space, so being able to
traverse the children in a sensible and predictable way is essential.

\subsection[Morton Code]{Morton Code (Z-Order)}
\label{sub:morton_code_z_order_}

Perhaps the most natural order to give to the values in a spatial quadtree is
to number them from 1 to 4, left to right, top to bottom. This can be made
more appropriate for a computer to use by numbering from 0 to 3. This is
called Morton Order\cite{mortoncomputer} or Z-order because of the resulting
path that would be followed by traversing the nodes in order,
Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-z-order.pdf}. This has several useful features.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, the numbers can be converted to base 2:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 0 becomes 00
		\item 1 becomes 01
		\item 2 becomes 10 and
		\item 3 becomes 11.
	\end{itemize}

	\item This has advantages since binary is very efficient for computers to
	work with and allows certain tricks to be employed (see Morton order
	coordinates.

	\item Also, this numbering system is easily extendible to any depth of
	tree that can be imagined.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The root, as mentioned before, is given no value,
		\item each of the children are numbered {00} through 11.

		\item the children of these children are numbered 00 to 11 with the
		parent as a prefix. So the children of node 00 are 0000, 0001, 0010
		and 0011. Likewise, the children of 11 are 1100, 1101, 1110 and 1111.

		\item The children are always numbered in the same order. If starting
		at the top and going top to bottom and left to right, this is
		maintained for all children.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

This method of numbering is simple and so acceptable for the standard uses of
quadtrees, but it was found to be difficult to work with in a spatial context
when information about neighbouring cells is needed. The steps required to
calculate the neighbours of any given cell are reasonably complex and so would
add computational and time complexity to calculations performed on the tree.

\subsection{Hilbert Order}
\label{sub:hilbert_order}

One of the reasons the Z-order above becomes difficult to work with is that
the resulting path from traversing the nodes in-order has to make large jumps
and so cells which are numbered next to each other may, in fact, not be near
each other in the image.

A number of routes exist that avoid this jumping around the image. These are
based on space filling curves which have the property of being a simple
recursive pattern that visits every point in a 2D space exactly once. These
curves were first discovered in the early 1900's and described mathematically
by D. Hilbert\cite{hilbert1970stetige}. One of the curves that Hilbert found,
the Hilbert Curve, is particularly useful since it can be represented in the
simplest level in a two by two square which is then recursively repeated for
each quadrant of that first square---exactly as the quadtree does.

The path that the traversal of points follows becomes fairly complicated,
Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-hilbert-order.pdf}. This means, again, that the
calculation of neighbours becomes difficult.

\subsection{Gray Codes}
\label{sub:gray_codes}

The Gray Code\cite{gray1953pulse}, developed by Frank Gray in 1953, was
originally designed to reduce the error rate produced by mechanical
electronics. The code is a variation on binary where each step when counting
up changes only a single bit at a time. This meant that electromechanical
apperatus was less likely to make a mistake or generate errors since the
actions required to count from one to two required only a single bit change,
rather than two, as would be required for binary counting. When using just two
bits, i.e.\ couting from zero to three, the steps are very similar to binary.

\begin{tabular}{c c l}
0 & 00 \\
1 & 01 \\
2 & 11 \\
3 & 01
\end{tabular}

The path that this follows is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-gray-order.pdf}. This does not seem to provide any
benefits since there is now more jumping around the image space than with
Z-order and the neighbours are just as difficult to calculate as for Hilbert
Order. However, by using a different arangement of the sub-trees, as the
Hilbert curve does, the leaf nodes group themselves in a very ordered
fasion. When arranged as in Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-modgray-order.pdf}
and~\ref{fig:modgray-traversal}, each cell is arranged such that
