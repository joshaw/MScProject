\section{Quadtrees}
\label{sec:quadtrees}

Since the simple grid method described in Section~\ref{sec:simple_grid_method}
performs slowly and does not offer good cluster analysis, a different approach
is needed. The chosen method is to use a quadtree data structure.

Quadtrees are a type of recursive abstract data type in the form of a tree
where every node has exactly zero or four children. A node with zero children
is a leaf and contains some information, value or quantity. A node with four
children is not a leaf and cannot hold information.

Quadtrees are often used in image processing since the four children of the
root node can naturally represent the four quadrants of an image; upper left,
upper right, lower left and lower right. Since each of these children is also a
quadtree, the image can be subdivided to any arbitrary depth. From this point,
information about the image can be ``seen'' more easily by the computer and
statistics calculated.

\subsection{Quadtree Definitions}
\label{sub:quadtree_definitions}

It is useful to define a few terms that shall be used in the context of
quadtrees. Many of these are identical to the definitions more commonly applied
to binary trees.

\begin{description}
	\item[Node] (Cell, element) A leaf in the tree which holds some
		information, value or quantity.
	\item[Root Node] The node at the topmost position in the tree. It has no
		parents and is never a leaf.
	\item[Child] One of the four nodes that are beneath a given node for which
		there is a direct path of length 1 between this node and it.
	\item[Height] The length of the longest path from the root node to one of
		the leaf nodes.
	\item[Depth] The length of the path from a given node up to the root.
	\item[Completeness] A quadtree is `complete' when each of the root node's
		four children have the same height. In this case, the number of leaves
		in the tree is a maximum.
	\item[Quadtree Code] (Code) A unique number or value that is assigned to a
		node by adding its position with respect to its siblings to the code of
		its parent.
\end{description}

\subsection{Code Orderings}
\label{sub:code_orderings}

In order to identify a node uniquely in the tree, each node is given a code
that is built up from it's parent's code plus some value that identifies it
among it's siblings. The root node is usually chosen to have an empty code so
that the first four children are given the first level codes.

The choice of what order to label the children is important if the order
in which the nodes are placed is important. For spatial indexing, for example,
each node represents a quadrant in two dimensional space, so being able to
traverse the children in a sensible and predictable way is essential.

		order developed for this project.}\label{fig:order_traversals}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection[Morton Order]{Morton Order (Z-Order)}
\label{ssub:morton_code_z_order_}

Perhaps the most natural order to give to the values in a spatial quadtree is
to number them from 1 to 4, left to right, top to bottom. This can be made more
appropriate for a computer to use by changing to zero based indexing,
numbering from 0 to 3. This is called Morton Order\cite{mortoncomputer} or
Z-order because of the resulting path that would be followed by traversing the
nodes in order, Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-z-order.pdf}. This has several useful
features.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, the numbers can be converted to base 2; 0 becomes 00, 1
		becomes 01, 2 becomes 10, and 3 becomes 11.

	\item This has advantages since binary is very efficient for computers to
	work with and allows certain tricks to be employed (see Morton Order
	Coordinates below).

	\item Also, this numbering system is easily extendible to any depth of
	tree that can be imagined.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The root, as mentioned before, is given no value,
		\item each of the children are numbered {00} through 11.

		\item the children of these children are numbered 00 to 11 with the
		parent as a prefix. So the children of node 00 are 0000, 0001, 0010
		and 0011. Likewise, the children of 11 are 1100, 1101, 1110 and 1111.

		\item The children are always numbered in the same order. If starting
		at the top and going top to bottom and left to right, this is
		maintained for all children.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Morton Order Coordinates}
\label{ssub:morton_order_coordinates}

Another useful feature of the Morton ordering is the simple conversion from
quadtree code to Cartesian coordinate notation. The steps to convert to
coordinate form are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ensure the code is in binary format with two bits for each level of
		the tree.
	\item \emph{De-interleave} the bits of the code (starting with the first
		being given to the $y$-axis, assign bits to the $y$ and $x$ axes
		building up a binary value for each).
	\item Convert the resulting two binary value to decimal to give a standard
		decimal $(x,y)$ Cartesian coordinate.
\end{enumerate}

These steps result in a coordinates that represents the top left corner of the
node. The coordinate is dependant on the length of the code, so to compare two
coordinated from their codes, the codes must be of the same length.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3cm]{deinterleave.pdf}

	\caption[Decomposition of a Z-order code to give coordinates.]{Decomposition
		of a Z-order code using de-interleaving to give Cartesian coordinates.
		The bits of the code are alternately assigned to the y- and then
		x-coordinate which is then converted to decimal to given the final
		coordinate of the cell.}\label{fig:deinterleave}
\end{figure}

This method means that it is very easy to calculate an arbitrary number of
nodes in any direction by simply converting the code for a node to coordinates,
adding or subtracting the number of positions to move in the $x$ and $y$
directions and then converting back to quadtree code representation by
following the algorithm above in the reverse order.

Of course, this method has no knowledge of the structure of the quadtree being
used and so only provides the code of the node that would occupy the space at
the given coordinate. That node might not exist---the tree might not extend
deep enough, so the node in that position is larger than expected; or the tree
might be deeper at that location meaning the node is smaller. In these cases,
there are a number of options as to how to find the correct node for the code:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The code can be shortened and/or lengthened and the resulting adapted
		code checked to see if it is in the tree. This trial and error method
		can be fastest when there is a limit on the depth range allowed when
		searching (see Section~\ref{sub:algorithm_description}).
	\item The tree can be traversed, starting at the root, to find the nearest
		node to the expected code reference.
\end{itemize}

The first of these is used in the plugin since it allows the hash map structure
to be used when searching which speeds up the process.

\subsubsection{Hilbert Order}
\label{ssub:hilbert_order}

One of the reasons the Z-order above becomes difficult to work with is that
the resulting path from traversing the nodes in-order has to make large jumps
and so cells which are numbered next to each other may, in fact, not be near
each other in the image. This property is known as being continuous.

A number of routes exist that avoid this jumping around the image. These are
based on space filling curves which have the property of being simple recursive
patterns that visit every point in a 2D space exactly once. These curves were
first discovered in the early 1900's and described mathematically by David
Hilbert\cite{hilbert1970stetige}. One of the curves that Hilbert found, the
Hilbert Curve, is particularly useful since it can be represented in the
simplest level in a two by two square which is then recursively repeated for
each quadrant of that first square---exactly as the quadtree is.

The path that the traversal of points follows becomes fairly complicated,
Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-hilbert-order.pdf}, meaning that the calculation of
neighbours becomes difficult as there is no simple way to traverse the path an
arbitrary distance. Two of the neighbours are always simple to find by simply
going a single step forward and backward, but the others are far more complex.

\subsubsection{Gray Codes}
\label{ssub:gray_codes}

The Gray Code, developed by Frank Gray in 1953\cite{gray1953pulse}, was
originally designed to reduce the error rate produced by mechanical
electronics. The code is a variation on binary where each step, when
incrementing, changes only a single bit at a time. This meant that
electromechanical apparatus was less likely to make a mistake or generate
errors since the actions required to count from one to two required only a
single bit change, rather than two, which would be required for binary
counting.  When using just two bits, i.e., counting from zero to three, the
steps are very similar to binary, (00, 01, 11, 10).

The path that this follows is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:traverse-gray-order.pdf}. This does not seem to provide any
benefits since there is now more jumping around the image space than with
Z-order and the neighbours are just as difficult to calculate as for Hilbert
Order. However, by using a different arrangement for each of the sub-trees, as
the Hilbert curve does, the leaf nodes group themselves in a very ordered
fashion.  When arranged as in Figures~\ref{fig:traverse-modgray-order.pdf}
and~\ref{fig:modgray-traversal}, each cell is arranged such that the codes for
any two neighbouring nodes at the same depth differs by exactly one bit. This
means that checking if any two nodes are neighbours becomes trivial.

		\subref{fig:modgray-2-levels-arrows.pdf}. This has the advantage that
		neighbouring nodes have codes which differ by exactly one bit,
		\subref{fig:modgray-2-levels-numbers.pdf}.}\label{fig:modgray-traversal}

\subsubsection{Other Orderings}
\label{ssub:other_orderings}

As well as the orderings discussed above, there are also a number of other
space filling curves and dis-joint orderings that were discounted.
Figure~\ref{fig:modgray-2-alternatives} shows some of these.

\begin{itemize}

	\item Figure~\ref{fig:modgray-alt-order.pdf} shows \emph{row order}
		traversal of the grid. This is extremely simple to implement for a
		simple grid-like arrangement, but is very awkward and looses much of
		the information when using quadtrees.

	\item Figure~\ref{fig:modgray-alt-prime.pdf} shows \emph{row-prime order},
		also known as snake-order\cite{goodchild1983optimizing}, traversal.
		This is a slight modification of row order which is continuous but,
		again, is not recursive so not suitable for use with quadtrees.

	\item Figure~\ref{fig:modgray-alt-rotated.pdf} is identical to them
		modified Gray order above, but with a single \SI{90}{\degree} rotation.
		Since the orientation of an image has no effect on the clusters found,
		all rotations and reflections provide the same functionality as the
		original. The particular form chosen is simply due to {\ae}sthetic
		preference.

	\item Figure~\ref{fig:modgray-alt-pinwheel.pdf} shows an alteration to the
		modified Gray code order, named \emph{pinwheel order}, where, instead of
		reflecting the quadrants, each is rotated about it's center
		\SI{90}{\degree} so that the whole image is rotationally symmetric,
		something the modified Gray code lacks.  This form turns out not to
		provide any additional features and makes conversion from quadtree code
		to coordinate representation substantially more difficult.

		discounted.}\label{fig:modgray-2-alternatives}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Chosen Ordering}
\label{ssub:Chosen Ordering}

Despite the promising features of the modified Gray ordering, the simple Morton
ordering is used when constructing quadtrees in the ImageJ plugin. This is due
to the issues encountered when developing a method of discovering neighbours of
nodes in the modified Gray code system. It was found that, despite there being
an assurance that two neighbours' codes differ by exactly one bit, this cannot
provide a one to one mapping with the required neighbours of that node.

Consider, for example, a node, $S$, at a depth of three in the tree where the
rook's case neighbours (see Section~\ref{sub:choosing_neighbours}) are
required. This node has a code consisting of 6 bits, two for each level. From
this code, a total of six possible neighbour candidates can be identified by
simply flipping each of the bits in the code.  These neighbours are shown for
an example node in Table~\ref{tab:s-neighbours} and their position relative to
the original shown in Figure~\ref{fig:modgray-failures}. The first two of these
possible neighbours, the results of flipping the two least significant bits,
are guaranteed always to be valid neighbours since they share the same parent
as $S$. However, the two other neighbours which need to be selected from the
remaining four possibilities, cannot be identified easily.  These other
possible neighbours exist at other locations in the quadtree, always either
vertically above or below or horizontally to the left or right of $S$, but
there is no simple test to determine if they are actually neighbours or not.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabu}{c c c}
		\toprule Node $S$ & Neighbours \\
		\cmidrule{1-2} \multirow{6}{*}{101001}

		& 10\textbf{0}001 & \\
		& 1\textbf{1}1001 & \\
		& \textbf{0}01001 & \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabu}
	\caption[The possible neighbours for a node using modified Gray
		ordering.]{The possible neighbours for a node using modified Gray

\end{table}

\begin{figure}[tbhp]

	\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{modgray-failures.pdf}
	\caption[Flipping code bits gives too many possible neighbours.]{Flipping
		the bits of the code to get possible neighbours gives too many
		possibilities to be able to select the correct neighbours. This problem
		is exaggerated as the node gets deeper in the tree since there are more
		bits in the code to change. The incorrect neighbours are always in line
		with the original and represent what would be neighbours if the tree
		was some number of levels shallower.}\label{fig:modgray-failures}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Constructing Orderings in Code}
\label{sub:constructing_orderings_in_code}

Since the quadtree is a recursive data structure, it is necessary to be able to
maintain the correct orientation of child trees with respect to their parents
at the construction stage. It turns out that this is easy to achieve and thus
adapting it for each of the arrangements discussed above is simply a matter of
adjusting the next part of the code that is added for each of the four children
when creating them. Pseudo code to achieve this for Morton order is shown in
Listing~\ref{code:child-construction}. The constructor for a quadtree is
\texttt{Quadtree(max\_x, max\_y, code)}, where \texttt{code} is the new portion
of code to be added for that child.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

	b_l = new Quadtree(100, 100, this.code + "10");
	b_r = new Quadtree(100, 100, this.code + "11");
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsection{Hash Table Implementation}
\label{sub:hash_table_implementation}

In order to speed up the subsequent operations applied to the quadtree
structure, it can be converted to a simpler, one dimensional data structure.
The method discussed above, to number the cells in a logical fashion based on
the code of the parent, can be viewed as a way to map the two dimensional image
to a single unique binary code, and hence to a one dimensional format. Thus,
the quadtree can be easily converted to an array structure by simply using the
key code as the array index. Once this is performed the access complexity is
significantly reduced. This operation is only performed once after the quadtree
has been generated meaning the amortized complexity is reduced.

As mentioned on page~\pageref{prt:custom_algorithm}, using a na\"{\i}ve
implementation has the potential to have a very poor space usage if the image
is not densely populated (in which case it is likely that few clusters would be
identifiable anyway). Instead, an implementation is created that makes use of
the \emph{hash table} data structure\cite{cormen2001introduction}. This allows
the data structure to increase in size dynamically as more space is needed, but
also provides linear time complexity for access, modification and search. The
quadtree code is used as the key for the hash table, and the data stored within
the cell with that code is the hash table value.

Using this data structure means that several operations are significantly sped
up. For example, for the quadtree format, the steps required to check if a
given code is present involves traversing the tree as specified by the code to see if a node with that code is found, thus a time
complexity of $O(\log n)$.  However, for a hash table, the hash function is
used to get a hash of the code to be checked and the appropriate location
checked. If the codes match, then the code does appear in the tree, a total of
two operations, and so constant $O(1)$.

Since the quadtree structure is defined recursively, it is not possible to
directly access a given location of the data. Instead it must be arrived at by
starting at the root, and, for every level, deciding which of the children the
destination exists in. This would be a time consuming step for a number of
operations, but the biggest effect would be when checking the neighbours of
cells since for every neighbour of every node, the tree must be traversed. This
is not an issue for the hash table since the single dimensional nature means
that data anywhere can be accessed directly.

Little spatial information should be lost during the conversion from quadtree
to hash table since this is all contained in the quadtree code assigned to the
node during the quadtree generation step. However, the quadtree representation
can be kept in memory for some processes. For example, to get all of the leaf
nodes of a given node, it is enough to start at that node and traverse the tree
in post- or pre-order and return the nodes that are arrived at, $O(\log n)$,
whereas, for the hash table, each node must be checked to decide if it is a
child, $O(n)$.

A hash table requires two pieces of information for each entry: a \emph{key}
and a \emph{value}. The key is what is used to locate items, its hash is used
as the index of the internal array. The value is the information that should be
accessible when using the key. For this application, since more than a single
piece of information should be accessible for each quadtree code, an object is
stored against each key. This has the format shown in
Table~\ref{tab:hashmap-columns}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
