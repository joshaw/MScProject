\section{Data File Structure}
\label{app:data_file_structure}

The data files that are produced from the initial analysis of the images have a
standard format.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tab separated fields.
	\item Single header line with names of fields.
	\item One or more items of data, separated by newlines.
\end{enumerate}

The columns that represent fields in the file are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{Channel Name}
		\item \texttt{X}
		\item \texttt{Y}
		\item \texttt{Xc}
		\item \texttt{Yc}
		\item \texttt{Height}
		\item \texttt{Area}
		\item \texttt{Width}
		\item \texttt{Phi}
		\item \texttt{Ax}
		\item \texttt{BG}
		\item \texttt{I}
		\item \texttt{Frame}
		\item \texttt{Length}
		\item \texttt{Valid}
		\item \texttt{Z}
		\item \texttt{Zc}
		\item \texttt{Photons}
		\item \texttt{Lateral Localisation Accuracy}
		\item \texttt{Xw}
		\item \texttt{Yw}
		\item \texttt{Xwc}
		\item \texttt{Ywc}
\end{itemize}

Only the \texttt{Xc} and \texttt{Yc} columns, which represent the x- and y-
coordinate of the data point, are used.
