		\part*{Abstract}

		\vspace{1cm}
		This project introduces the concept of data clustering and its uses in
		medical and biological image analysis and examines some existing
		techniques for extracting clustering information from such data sets. A
		new technique based on quadtree style data structures is discussed and
		an implementation tested and evaluated based on this technique. This
		method is found to perform well even under difficult conditions, such
		as noisy data, where others struggle, though has limitations in data
		set size, resource usage and taking advantage of parallel processing.
