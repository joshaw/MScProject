\part{Cluster Analysis}
\label{prt:cluster_analysis}

Cluster analysis is the grouping of a set of objects or items in a spatially or
informationally logical way such that the items that are placed in the same
group are more similar to each other than they are to the objects in the other
groups in the set. These groups shall be called \emph{clusters}. When dealing
with images, the clustering that is of interest is often based on spatial
location, i.e., clusters should be composed of objects that are close together
in the image and clusters should be separated by regions of emptiness or
background level noise.

There are a number of alternative methods of identifying clusters in images.
