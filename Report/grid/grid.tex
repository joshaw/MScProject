\section{Simple Grid Method}
\label{sec:simple_grid_method}

The simplest method for analysing the distribution of points is to use a
regular grid of cells and place the points into the cells one at a time. Once
all points have been added, the number of points per cell can be treated as a
greyscale birghtness value. This gives a simple pixel-image, with brightness as
a function of density, in the pnm image format. A thresholding filter can then
be applied to remove the points that are isolated and leave the denser areas
coresponding to clusters.

Though the resolution of this method can be easily changed by altering the size
of the cells and the grid, it performs badly when presented with data that is
even slightly noisy. If the clusters themselves have a density that is not
significantly above the background noise level, the thresholding step is prone
to either exclude much of the real data, or to increase the size of the
clusters by including too much noise. These two effects can be seen clearly in
Figure~\ref{fig:grid-noise}, where \texttt{palm-1.txt} was used with a cell
size of 200. The range of the data is from 0 to 41000 for both the $x$ and the
$y$ axes, thus the images are 205 by 205 pixels. This data took
\SI{0.495}{\second} to generate.

    \caption{Setting a low threshold, \subref{fig:grid-noise-low.png}, means
    that many of the points in the clusters are lost. Setting it higher,
    \subref{fig:grid-noise-high.png}, includes too many of the points deemed to
    be noise.}\label{fig:grid-noise}
