\section{Possible Improvements}
\label{sec:possible_improvements}

Though the primary  aims of this project were fulfilled, there are a few areas
that could be improved, or features that could be added that would improve the
plugin and make it easier to use. These features were not developed during the
course of this project because the core functionality was more important and
time constraints prevented them from being added after the existing features
were complete.

	\item[Alternative algorithms] \hfill \\

		The algorithm that was developed for this project performs well under a
		range of different conditions. This was tested through the use of
		exemplar data sets and data sets constructed for use in testing to
		simulate different conditions. However, there may be some situations
		that were not tested for which it might not perform well. To avoid
		this, a number of alternative algorithms could be included so that, if
		the default algorithm fails, the user could switch to a different
		approach which might handle the data better.

		One or more of the existing algorithms discussed in
		Section~\ref{sec:existing_clustering_algorithms} could be implemented
		as alternatives which could then be selected from the main user
		interface if the quadtree based method failed.
