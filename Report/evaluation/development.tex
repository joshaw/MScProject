\section{Development Evaluation}
\label{sec:development_evaluation}

The development process of this project followed an agile methodology. There
was a distinction in steps between the initial design of the data structures
and algorithms and the development of the program and the plugin for ImageJ.
There were stages of development of the algorithms and the plugin which were
revisited a number of times during the development.

The estimated schedule that were proposed prior to the start of development
are listed in Table~\ref{tab:schedule}. This was followed reasonably closely
throughout the project, though some deviations were encountered when the
development of algorithms took longer than was expected. In particular, issues
when designing the modified Gray code quadtree ordering slowed development
significantly. See Section~\ref{ssub:Chosen Ordering} for the reasons. To
account for these changes, other stages were allocated slightly less time than
is recorded here.
