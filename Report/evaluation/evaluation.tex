\section{Development Evaluation}
\label{sec:development_evaluation}

The development process of this project followed an agile methodology. There
was a distinction in steps between the initial design of the data structres and
algorithms and the development of the program and the plugin for ImageJ. There
were stages of development of the algorithms and the plugin which were
revisited a number of times during the development.
