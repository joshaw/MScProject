\part{Evaluation}
\label{prt:evaluation}

The aim of this project was to develop a plugin for the ImageJ software to
perform cluster analysis of sub-diffraction limit data. This was achieved with
a functioning piece of software in the form of a plugin that is able to perform
well with a number of different testing situations. An evaluation of the extent
to which this plugin satisfies the requirements and the development process are
described below.
